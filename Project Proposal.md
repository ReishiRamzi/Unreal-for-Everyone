##What is the problem we are trying to solve?
- as an interdisciplinary liberal arts college, we have made a committment to provide students the space and tools to explore their academic interests and creativity. Currently, there is no curriculum in place to prepare students for the current and emerging market of real time simulations, mixed reality media, and games development.
- Students from myriad academic programs engage in creating projects. Unreal Engine can augment students' ability to create immersive projects that help them communicate their vision in novel, engaging ways. 
- Unreal Engine is a complex software tool with a steep learning curve. 
- Real-time rendering skills are at an all time high demand, and the demand for these skills are increasing continually. The future of careers media, computer science, and the arts are expanding in the direction of real-time interactive simulations.

##How are we going to solve it?
- By creating a curriculum to guide learning, students will be able to traverse the learning curve with support.
- Students and faculty will be aware and have knowledge of a new software tool to realize their creative visions through program markeing and advocacy.
- Academic departments will cooperate to share expertise and overcome challenges through cooperation. Students from varying backgrounds will gain exposure to new modes of thinking.
- project frameworks will be created to give users a starting point in creating their projects and a support structure to take their vision through to completion.
- Prepare students for the future of new media by introducing them to the future of industry tools in a guided learning environment.

##Why is this solution better than existing solutions?
- this solution is not just a course or a workshop, but an institutional initiative engaging students as well as faculty and staff, preparing them to feel empowered to create with the rising industry standard.
- This solution is not for games development, but leveraging the powerful Unreal Engine for realizing creative visions across many disciplines. We will teach the fundamental concepts necessary to be empowered to create.


##Who is the audience?
- The audience for this initiative is students, faculty, and staff.
- Students from the computer science, art, theatre, media, and psychology.
- faculty and staff from Digital learning, and respective student programs
