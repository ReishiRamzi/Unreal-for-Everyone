## What is the problem we are trying to solve?
- as an interdisciplinary liberal arts college, we have made a committment to provide students the space and tools to explore their academic interests and creativity. Currently, there is no curriculum in place to prepare students for the current and emerging market of real time simulations, mixed reality media, and games development.
- Students from myriad academic programs engage in creating projects. Unreal Engine can augment students' ability to create immersive projects that help them communicate their vision in novel, engaging ways. 
- Unreal Engine is a complex software tool with a steep learning curve. 
- Real-time rendering skills are at an all time high demand, and the demand for these skills are increasing continually. The future of careers media, computer science, and the arts are expanding in the direction of real-time interactive simulations.

## How are we going to solve it?
- By creating a curriculum to guide learning, students will be able to traverse the learning curve with support.
- Students and faculty will be aware and have knowledge of a new software tool to realize their creative visions through program markeing and advocacy.
- Academic departments will cooperate to share expertise and overcome challenges through cooperation. Students from varying backgrounds will gain exposure to new modes of thinking.
- project frameworks will be created to give users a starting point in creating their projects and a support structure to take their vision through to completion.
- Prepare students for the future of new media by introducing them to the future of industry tools in a guided learning environment.

## Why is this solution better than existing solutions? How is it different?
- This solution is not just a course or a workshop, but an institutional initiative engaging students as well as faculty and staff, preparing them to feel empowered to create with the rising industry standard.
- This solution is not for games development, but leveraging the powerful Unreal Engine for realizing creative visions across many disciplines. We will teach the fundamental concepts necessary to be empowered to create.

## Who is the audience?
- The audience for this initiative is students, faculty, and staff.
- Students from the computer science, art, theatre, media, and psychology.
- Faculty and staff from Digital learning, and respective student programs
- Double major students, such as computer science and media, would benefit from the program.

CG 225 Introduction to 3D Computer Graphics (3 cr.)
This course introduces students to 3D software and practices
for production. Topics include organization strategies, modeling,
unwrapping, texture mapping, rigging, lighting, and cameras




Two options
CG 125 Introduction to 3D Production for Designers (3 cr.)
Prerequisite(s): ART 102 or ART 105
This course introduces game designers to the 3D production
process. The course begins with the basics of interface
organization strategies, equipment options, and production
elements. The class also introduces techniques for texture
mapping, modeling, rigging, lighting, cameras, and animation.


CG 275 Introduction to 3D Animation (3 cr.)
Prerequisite(s): CG 225, ANI 151
This course explores and exercises the concepts and
techniques of 3D animation through a series of assignments
applied to characters. The course emphasizes character
development in the expression of personality, mood, thought,
and attitude through motion and posing.
CG 300 3D Environment and Level Design (3 cr.)
Prerequisite(s): CG 275
This course introduces students to the principles of 3D
environment design. Theatrical sets, architectural simulations,
and level design are considered. In order to provide students
with a broader skill set, this course also presents the mechanics
of how to use other 3D animation software, with an emphasis
on the unique strengths of the package. Students explore the
comparative strengths of different software packages and the
impact that this has on workflow. The course emphasizes critical
thinking skills and strategies for tool selection.
